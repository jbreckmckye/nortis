## JavaScript with canvas

The first implementation is a prototype in a high-level language. Working in JavaScript means we can quickly build an
idea of the overall approach, before moving to C and the more involved SDKs.

Although we're working in JS, we avoid availing ourselves of many high level language features like closures, higher
order functions, or object orientation. The code is meant to resemble the C code we will write later for MacOS and
PlayStation.
